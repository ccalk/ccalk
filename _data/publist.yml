- title: "Abstract strategies and coherence"
  image: puzzle-piece-template-13.jpeg
  description: We formalise the notion of normalisation strategy, from abstract rewriting, in the formal algebraic setting of higher Kleene algebra. This leads to a succinct algebraic proof of the Squier coherence theorem for abstract rewriting systems.

- title: "lr-Multisemigroups, modal quantales end the origin of locality"

  description: We generalise the notion of small category as a set equipped with multi-operations, and link these to modal quantales, in particular exploring the locality axiom for the domain operator.

  description: By equipping natural homotopy with a composition pairing, a notion due to T Porter, we show that time-reversal is captured by categorical opposition.

  description: The syntax and semantics of first order logic can be fully expressed using the notion of cograph. We extend this to arbitrary graphs and prove basic completeness results.
